# Master's Thesis

This Master's thesis presents a framework for decomposing inflation in Brazil, drawing on the methodology proposed by [Shapiro (2020)](https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp2020-29.pdf). The study aims to analyze Brazilian inflation through various decompositions, including cyclical versus acyclical and persistent versus non-persistent components. It employs sector-specific estimates to identify and categorize these components, utilizing the Phillips Curve to explore the relationship between aggregate demand and inflation across different sectors. Additionally, the methodology is adaptable for assessing the impact of economic crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis, by incorporating relevant dummy variables. The objective is to provide central banks and policymakers with an in-depth understanding of inflation dynamics, thereby informing the formulation of monetary and fiscal policy decisions.
